# Ape Church Game Submissions

This repository is the **intake and preview platform** for games built by Ape Church partners. Submitted games are reviewed here and, once approved, manually integrated into the live platform.

You can browse all submitted games at **[submissions.ape.church](https://submissions.ape.church)** *(update with your Vercel URL)*.

---

## Before You Start

You will need:
- A GitHub account
- Your game built using the official game template
- All assets compressed and ready (WebP or PNG, MP3 or OGG — no WAV files)

Game template: **[ape-church-game-template](https://github.com/ape-church/ape-church-game-template)**

---

## Submission Flow

### Step 1 — Build your game using the template

Go to the game template repository and click **"Use this template"** → **"Create a new repository"**. This creates a clean copy in your GitHub account.

Build your game inside the template. The files you will submit are:

```
components/games/your-game-name/     ← your game components
public/submissions/your-game-name/   ← your game assets
```

Follow all lifecycle and structure requirements in the template README before submitting.

---

### Step 2 — Fork this repository

Fork `ape-church-game-submissions` into your GitHub account. Your PR will come from this fork.

---

### Step 3 — Add your game files

In your fork, add exactly these files — nothing else:

```
components/
  games/
    your-game-name/
      YourGame.tsx
      YourGameWindow.tsx
      YourGameSetupCard.tsx
      yourGameConfig.ts       ← optional, for game configuration constants
      ... (any other game components)

public/
  submissions/
    your-game-name/
      card.png          ← REQUIRED, 1:1 aspect ratio (e.g. 512x512)
      banner.png        ← REQUIRED, 2:1 aspect ratio (e.g. 1024x512)
      ... (other assets)

submissions/
  your-team-name/
    your-game-name/
      metadata.json   ← REQUIRED, see schema below
```

> **One game per PR.** Do not include files from multiple games in a single pull request.

**Using an AI agent to copy your files?**

If you're using Claude Code, Cursor, or another AI coding agent, you can ask it to copy your files automatically. Clone this submissions repo locally, open your agent inside it, and send this prompt:

```
I have a game I built in the Ape Church game template repo.
It is located at: [path to your template repo on your machine]
e.g. ../my-game-repo or /Users/yourname/projects/my-game-repo

My game name is: [your-game-name] (kebab-case)
My team name is: [your-team-name] (kebab-case)

Please copy the following files from my template repo into
this submissions repo in the correct structure:

From template:
  components/my-game/ → components/games/[your-game-name]/
  public/my-game/ → public/submissions/[your-game-name]/
  metadata.json → submissions/[your-team-name]/[your-game-name]/metadata.json

Do not copy any other files. After copying, confirm what
was moved and check that the folder names match exactly.
```

After the agent runs, verify the structure matches the file tree above before moving on.

---

### Step 4 — Review your metadata.json

Your `metadata.json` was copied over from the template in the previous step. Open `submissions/your-team-name/your-game-name/metadata.json` and verify:

- All fields are filled in with your game's actual information
- `team` and `gameName` match your folder names exactly
- `submittedAt` is updated to today's date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format
- `status` is `"pending"` — do not change this
- `revenueShare` is filled out with correct names, telegram usernames, and ERC-20 addresses
- All `share` values add up to exactly 100
- `address` must be a valid ERC-20 address to receive Ape Coin — double-check this carefully, payments are sent to this address automatically
---

### Step 5 — Open a Pull Request

Open a PR from your fork to the `main` branch of this repository.

**PR title format:** `[Team Name] Game Name` — e.g. `[Balloons] Ape Strong`

When you open the PR, automated checks will run immediately. All checks must pass before your submission will be reviewed. If a check fails, the error message will tell you exactly what to fix.

---

## Review Process

1. Automated checks run on your PR — fix any failures before waiting for review
2. Our team reviews your code and leaves feedback directly on the PR
3. Make any requested changes in your fork — the PR updates automatically
4. Once approved, our team merges the PR and your game appears on the preview site
5. Approved games are manually integrated into the live platform

> Merging a PR does not guarantee production deployment. Approval and live launch are separate steps.

---

## Do Not Include

The following will cause your PR checks to fail:

- `package.json`, `package-lock.json`
- `next.config.ts` or `next.config.js`
- `tsconfig.json`
- Any files in `app/`, `lib/`, or `components/games/shared/`
- `.wav` audio files (use MP3 or OGG)
