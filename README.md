# Game Submissions

This repository is used to **submit and review games** built using the official game template.

It is an **intake and review repository only**. Games submitted here are **not live by default**.

---

## How to Submit a Game

1. **Fork the `ape-church-game-template` repository**

   * Build your game in your own fork
   * Follow all required structure and lifecycle rules
  
    [https://github.com/ape-church/ape-church-game-template](https://github.com/ape-church/ape-church-game-template)

2. **Create a folder for your team or partner**

   * In this repository, submissions are organized by partner
   * If this is your first submission, create a new top-level folder using your **team or partner name** (kebab-case)

3. **Add your game inside your team folder**

   * Each game should live in its own folder
   * One game per folder

   Example structure:

   ```
   submissions/
   └── your-team-name/
       └── your-game-name/
           ├── README.md
           ├── src/
           ├── assets/
           └── metadata.json
   ```

4. **Open a Pull Request to this repository**

   * Source: your forked repository
   * Target: this repository (`game-submissions`)
   * **One Pull Request per game**
